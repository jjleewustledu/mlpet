Matlab methods for PET.

Provides functionality for reading and performing computations with arterial input data obtained from well counters and automatatd arterial sampling systems.  
There is support for autoradiography analysis by the methods of Peter Hersccovitch, Tom Videen, Bayesian models of water distribution in the brain, 
cross calibration across scanner, well counter, dose calibration devices.  There is support for decay correction methods.   Absttractions of PET-related functionality is provided by Interface classes.

Specific support is provided for:

  - the Capintec Caprac well counter, incorporating calibration data
  - the Swisstrace Twilite arterial sample-detection system
